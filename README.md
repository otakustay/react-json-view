# react-json-view

A customizable json view component for react, included features:

1. Visualize any JSON object to a tree style.
2. Expand or collapse object or array properties.
3. Custom rendering of any value.
4. Built-in render functions like copy property value.
5. CSS theme support.

We don't plan to support editing feature recently.
